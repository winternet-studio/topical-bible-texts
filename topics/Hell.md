“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

“Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.” (John 5:28, 29)

“as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” (Jude 7)

“and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly...” (2 Peter 2:6)

If wicked burned forever in hell it would mean they had “eternal life”.

“For behold, the day is coming, Burning like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts, that it will leave them neither root nor branch.” (Malachi 4:1)

“But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, ‘Not until the child [Samuel] is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there forever.’” (1 Samuel 1:22)

Samuel was not in the earthly temple forever.

“...as long as he liveth...” (1 Samuel 1:28)

Jonah was not in the whale forever.

“And Jonah a was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.” (Jonah 1:17)

Therefore forever must mean “until the end of the age.” (Matthew 13:40)

“But if you will not heed Me to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.” (Jeremiah 17:27)
