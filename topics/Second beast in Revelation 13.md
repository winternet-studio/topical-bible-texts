Second beast in Revelation 13
=============================

“And the Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let him who hears say, ‘Come!’ And let him who thirsts come. And whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.” (Revelation 22:17)

Jesus will never coerce. The Lamb offers freedom of choice.

Recapping Mark of the Beast:

“Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, his throne and great authority.” (Revelation 13:1-2)

Now the Bible brings another beast on the scene:

“He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.” (Revelation 13:10, 11)

This beast has no crowns like the first beast had. Does crowns mean a kingly power and the missing of crowns that it's a democracy?

“And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.” (Revelation 13:12)

“He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast...” (Revelation 13:13, 14)

“For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” (Revelation 16:14)

“He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.” (Revelation 13:15)

“Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.” (Romans 13:1)

In matters where God’s commandment are not at stake and in matters where obedience to God is not at stake, God tells us to be loyal citizens of society.

“Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.” (Revelation 19:20)

“Then He said to them, ‘Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.’” (Luke 21:10-12)

So there will be a power that will promote and join forces with the first beast (the papacy as we saw in [Mark of the Beast](Mark%20of%20the%20Beast.md)).

“To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)

“Then I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth - to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people. Saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.’” (Revelation 14:6, 7)

“Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

King Nebuchadnezzar said: “Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, good! But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?” (Daniel 3:15)

Will we stand the test like Daniel’s friends did?
