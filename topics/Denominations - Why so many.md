Why so many denominations?
==========================

“Now I saw when the Lamb [Jesus] opened one of the seals;... and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering and to conquer.” (Revelation 6:1, 2)

“Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another.” (Romans 12:10)

“...the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven,...” (Colossians 1:23)

“And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.” (Acts 5:14)

“We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)

White horse represents the pure faith.

“Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.” (Revelation 6:4)

Red horse represents Satan's attempt at persecuting the church. But he could not destroy the church through that though. So he changed strategy...

“When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, ‘Come and see.’ So I looked and behold a black horse, and he that sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine’” (Revelation 6:5, 6)

Black horse represents compromise and dilution of the faith.

“Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock... to shepherd the church of God... For I know this, that after my departure [Paul’s death] savage wolves [persecution] will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves, men will rise up speaking perverse [crooked] things, to draw away disciples after themselves.” (Acts 20:28-30)

Paul warns that salvation through Christ would be replaced by the requirements of the church.

“...think to change times and laws...” (Daniel 7:25)

“For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)

“When He opened the fourth seal, ... So I looked, and behold a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on him was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.” (Revelation 6:7, 8)

Pale horse represents church and state united, and persecution would happen again.

“But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Proverbs 4:18)

“Beloved, while I was diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints...” (Jude 3)

“There is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 8:1)

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God.” (Ephesians 2:8)

“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.” (John 16:12)

God raised up mighty men to restore different parts of lost truth but their followers only went as far as they went. Therefore we have ended up with so many denominations. But what is important is "the Bible and the Bible only" as our guide.

Jesus said “If you love me, keep My commandments.” (John 14:15)

“And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:9)

“...you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach, the Restorer of Streets to Dwell In. If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord honorable...” (Isaiah 58:12, 13)

“Here is the patience [endurance] of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)
