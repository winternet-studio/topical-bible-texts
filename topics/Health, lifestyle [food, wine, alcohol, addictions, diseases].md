“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health...” (3 John 2)

“...I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10)

“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” (Romans 12:1)

“And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him: for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and fountains of waters.” (Revelation 14:6, 7)

“So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31)

“Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20)

“Thou shalt not kill.” (Exodus 20:13)

“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13)

“Wine is a mocker [a deceiver], Strong [or intoxicating] drink is a brawler, whoever is led astray by it is not wise.” (Proverbs 20:1)

“Look not thou upon the wine when it is red [that’s when it is fermented], when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.” (Proverbs 23:31-33)

The Bible uses the word wine to refer to two distinctly different grape beverages, one unfermented, the other fermented. The Hebrew word yayin in the Old Testament and the Greek word oinos in the New Testament can mean either the fresh unfermented juice of the grape, or the fermented intoxicating drink. But the Bible is clear - it says drink the juice of the grape when it’s fresh, not when it’s fermented.

“No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)

“If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I’ll put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you.” (Exodus 15:26)

“And God said, ‘See I have given you every herb that yields seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.’” (Genesis 1:29)

“So all the days of Methuselah were 969 years; and he died.” (Genesis 5:27)

“You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his female; two each of animals that are unclean, a male and his female.” (Genesis 7:2)

“It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.” (Leviticus 3:17)

“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the animals which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth: Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing the cud-that you may eat.” (Leviticus 11:2, 3)

“Nevertheless, of those that chew the cud or have cloven hooves, you shall not eat, such as these: the camel, the hare, and the rock hyrax; for they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves; they are unclean for you. Also the swine is unclean for you, because it has cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcasses.” (Deuteronomy 14:7, 8)

“‘Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens after an idol in the midst, eating swine’s flesh and the abomination and the mouse, shall be consumed together,’ says the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:17)

“...no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.” (Psalm 84:11)

“These you may eat of all that are in the water: whatever in the water has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the river-that you may eat. But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are an abomination to you.” (Leviticus 11:9, 10)

“And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard, the kite, and the falcon after its kind; every raven after its kind, the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its kind; the little owl, the fisher owl, and the screech owl; the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture; the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.” (Leviticus 11:13-17)

Continue reading in Leviticus for further listings of animals to eat and not eat.

In the Bible there are three diets:

1. Unacceptable diet: the scavengers
	- God’s sewage disposal system (pigs on land, scavengers in the ocean)
2. Acceptable diet: clean meats
	- Diet God gave Noah and his family after the flood
3. Ideal diet: fruits, nuts, grains, vegetables
	- Diet God gave Adam and Eve in Eden

“Now while Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. He [Peter] said to them: ‘You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.’” (Acts 10:17)

Like all Jews Peter considered gentiles unclean. When Peter’s vision is read in context you see that the vision is a lesson inhow we should treat people, not about eating pigs.

“But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God...” (John 1:12)

“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God” (Luke 18:27)
