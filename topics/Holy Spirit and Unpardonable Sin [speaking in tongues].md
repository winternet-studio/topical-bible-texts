Holy Spirit and Unpardonable Sin (and speaking in tongues)
==========================================================

- Moses murdered - but God forgave him.
- Jacob lied to and deceived his father - but God forgave him. (Genesis 28:15)
- Peter denied Christ - but God forgave him.
- Paul denied God’s existence or persecuted and killed God’s people - but God forgave him.

“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)

“For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.” (Hebrews 8:12)

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

“Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.” (Matthew 12:31, 32)

The unpardonable sin is not a type of sin, it is the continual rejection of the prompting of the Holy Spirit until the point of where you have no interest in the spiritual things or the Bible. If I reject truth or resist truth I’m resisting Holy Spirit. That’s the function of the Holy Spirit, to open my mind to truth. Is that the unpardonable sin? Certainly not. If I take one step in this direction that's one thing, but if I continue walking away from Holy Spirit that is dangerous.

“And the LORD said, ‘My Spirit shall not strive with man forever,...’” (Genesis 6:3)

“...when He, the spirit of God is come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment...” (John 16:8)

“The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” (John 3:8)

“However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.” (John 16:13)

“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you...” (Acts 1:8)

“If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever — the Spirit of truth...” (John 14:15-17)

“And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those that obey him.” (Acts 5:32)

“Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.” (Psalm 51:11)

“Then Samuel said: ‘Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams.” (1 Samuel 15:22)

When Saul walked away from God:

“But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the Lord troubled him.” (1 Samuel 16:14)

About speaking in tongues:

“And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language.” (Acts 2:6)

“But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, **what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?** ... So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? ... There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without significance. Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me. Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, let it be for the edification of the church that you seek to excel. **Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.** For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. ... Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say? For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified. I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church I would **rather speak five words with my understanding**, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.” (1 Corinthians 14:13)

“If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.” (1 Corinthians 14:27)

“For God is not the author of confusion...” (1 Corinthians 14:33)
