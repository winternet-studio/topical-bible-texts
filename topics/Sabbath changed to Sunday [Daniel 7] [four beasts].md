“Study to show thyself approved unto God,...” (2 Timothy 2:15)

“And on the seventh day God ended His work, which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

“Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.” (Exodus 20:8-10)

“Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

“The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:27)

“...I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.” (Daniel 7:2, 3)

“The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off;...” (Daniel 7:4)

“And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between...” (Daniel 7:5)

“After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.” (Daniel 7:6)

“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.” (Daniel 7:7)

“The ten horns are ten kings who shall arise from this kingdom...” (Daniel 7:24)

“I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words.” (Daniel 7:8)

“...He shall be different from the first ones, and shall subdue three kings.” (Daniel 7:24)

“He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and law. Then the saints shall be given into his hand for a time, times and half a time.” (Daniel 7:25)

“...he [Satan] is a liar and the father of lies.” (John 8:44)

“Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?” (Matthew 15:3)

“If you love Me, keep my commandments.” (John 14:15)
