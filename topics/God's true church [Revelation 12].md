God's true church
=================

Does God have a church on earth today?

“I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades [hell] shall not prevail against it.” (Matthew 16:18)

“this” is not referring to Peter, but Jesus. Jesus Christ is The Rock. Hell *did* prevail against Peter - he denied Jesus three times.

“So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.” (Acts 16:5)

“And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.’” (Matthew 28:19-20)

“Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls... And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” (Acts 2:41, 47)

“So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.” (Acts 14:23)

Important principle to remember.
- You do not find truth by a church.
- You find truth by the Word of God.
- You find the church by the truth.

“Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth.” (Revelation 12:1, 2)

“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,... And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” (Revelation 12:7, 9)

“Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child.” (Revelation 12:13)

“And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne.” (Revelation 12:5)

“And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death [put their lives on the line for Christ].” (Revelation 12:11)

“Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.” (Revelation 12:6)

“I have appointed thee each day for a year” (Ezekiel 4:6)

1260 days = 1260 years. For further details on this time period see the topic [Mark of the Beast](Mark%20of%20the%20Best.md)

“And the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman [the church], and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17)

“Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

So God's true church is characterized by those who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus”. Notice that the commandments include the seventh day Sabbath, not the first day Sunday. Also notice, not just the faith *in* Jesus but *of* Jesus - we are to have the same faith as Jesus had, not just a faith in Him.

“And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, ‘See that you do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Revelation 19:10)

“Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 1:6, 7)

“And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers...” (Ephesians 4:11)

“And he said unto me, ‘For two thousand and three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.’” (Daniel 8:14)
