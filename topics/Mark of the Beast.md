Mark of the Beast
=================

“The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John.” (Revelation 1:1)

“Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth-to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people. Saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.” (Revelation 14:6, 7)

“And another angel followed, saying, ‘Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.’” (Revelation 14:8)

“Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‘If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God...” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

We see that true and false worship collide — there is a conflict between truth and error.

“Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they were created.” (Revelation 4:11)

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work; But the seventh day [Saturday] is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. ... For in six days the Lord made heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:8-11)

Earlier quotes of Revelation said we are to worship HIm who made heaven and earth.

“Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

“And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith...” (Romans 4:11)

A seal in the Bible is a sign of true worship.

“Bind up the testimony, Seal up the law among my disciples.” (Isaiah 8:16)

God’s seal is in the heart of God’s law.

“He ... shall intend to change times and law.” (Daniel 7:25)

Mark of Beast must have something do with the change of the Sabbath as well.

A quote from the publication, St. Catherince Catholic Church, Sentinel, May 21, 1995: “Perhaps the boldest thing, the most revolutionary change the Church ever did happened in the first century. The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to Sunday... not from any directions noted in Scriptures, but from the Church’s sense of its own power... People who think that the scripture should be the sole authority should logically become Seventhday Adventists and keep Saturday holy.”

A quote from Decretal De Translat. Espiscop. Cap.: “The Pope has the power to change times, to abrogate laws, and to dispense with all things, even the precepts of Christ.”

Here is clearly an issue with the Catholic system (not the people!).

“Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name... Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion... The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.” (Revelation 13:1, 2)

From previous studies we know that sea means peoples, nations, and tongues. Revelation 12:9 identifies the dragon as Satan. But Satan works through human agencies.

“Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:6-8)

“The Jews answered Him, saying, ‘For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, make Yourself God.’” (John 10:33)

Bible calls it blasphemy when man takes the prerogatives that belong to God.

“Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.” (2 Thessalonians 2:4)

Pope Leo XIII said: “We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.”

“And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, ‘Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone.” (Luke 5:21)

“And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.” (Revelation 13:5)

“I’ve given you a day for a year.” (Ezekiel 4:6)

Using the one prophetic day for a literal year principle: 1260 days is 1260 years.

The legally recognized supremacy of the pope began in A.D. 538 when there went into effect a decree of Emperor Justinian, making the bishop of Rome head of all the churches, the definer of doctrine and the corrector of heretics.

“And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded...” (Revelation 13:3)

Bible claims that at the end of the time period the papal power would suffer a deadly wound.

Encyclopedia Americana says: “In 1798 he [Berthier]... made his entrance into Rome, abolished the papal government and established a secular one.” Berthier took the pope into captivity in France.

Verse 3 continues: “...and his deadly wound was healed...”

On February 11, 1929 the headlines of San Francisco Chronicle read:
“Mussolini and Gasparri Signed Historic, Roman Pact. — The Roman question tonight was a thing of the past and the Vatican was at peace with Italy...In affixing the autographs to the memorable document healing the wound extreme cordiality was displayed on both sides.”

Verse 3 continues further: “...And all the world marveled and followed the beast.”

Has the papacy has gained worldwide influence, prestige and prominence in recent times?

“Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.” (Revelation 13:18)

Seven is a number of perfection. Six represents imperfection, man’s way, a counterfeit system.

Letter Oct. 28, 1895, from C.F. Thomas reads: “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change [from Sabbath to Sunday] was her act. And the act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.”

Catholic Record, September 1, 1923 reads: “Sunday is our mark of authority. The church is above the Bible. And this transference of the Sabbath observance is proof of that fact.”

“He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or in their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” (Revelation 13:15-17)

“Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)
