If God is good, why is there so much evil?
==========================================

“For you said to yourself ‘I will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God’s stars. I will preside on the mountain of the gods far away in the north. I will climb to the highest heavens and be like the Most High.’” (Isaiah 14:13-14)

“And war broke out in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought.” (Revelation 12:7)

“So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” (Revelation 12:9)

“Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.” (Revelation 12:12)

“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 6:12)

“For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” (John 3:17)

“Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.” (Hebrews 2:14)

So...

Because of the fight between good and evil - between Jesus and Satan.

Why did God create Lucifer with the capacity to choose to rebel? If you take away the power of choice, you take away the ability to love. Love can never be forced - it must be chosen.
