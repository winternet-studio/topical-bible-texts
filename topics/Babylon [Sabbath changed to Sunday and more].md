Babylon (Sabbath changed to Sunday and more)
============================================
- pure woman, scarlet woman, Sabbath to Sunday, immortality of the soul

“And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” (Revelation 12:1)

“For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:2)

In Revelation a woman represents the church, a pure woman that is loyal to her lover Jesus.

“Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication” (Revelation 17:1, 2)

A different woman - a different church.

“I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy...” (Revelation 17:3)

“And on her forehead a name was written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth” (Revelation 17:5)

The term Babylon means “confusion”.

The scarlet woman: “The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.” (Revelation 17:4)

A different cup: “I will take up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord.” (Psalm 116:13)

Revelation predicted that thousands would be deceived as the false teachings of ancient Babylon entered the church.

“They will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.” (2 Timothy 4:4)

“Sanctify them through Your truth. Your word is truth.” (John 17:17)

“And they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.’” (Genesis 11:4)

Nebuchadnezzar said in pride and arrogance: “Is this not great Babylon, that I have built?” (Daniel 4:30)

“Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:24)

“To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood” (Revelation 1:5)

Babylon offer’s human works as means to salvation. The fallen church passes around her wine cup of false doctrines substituting human works for the cross of Christ. God's people had, by way of the cross, their sins washed away in Christ’s blood.

“For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5)

We do not come to God through statues, images, icons, idols, or saints.

“...at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east.” (Ezekiel 8:16)

“And he shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, And shall intend to change times and law...” (Daniel 7:25)

“Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and forever.” (Hebrews 13:8)

“I am the Lord and I change not.” (Malachi 3:6)

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh-day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:8-11)

“Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth — to every
nation, tribe, tongue, and people — saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.’” (Revelation 14:6, 7)

“Hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.” (Ezekiel 20:20)

“So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord‘s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.” (Ezekiel 8:14)

Tammuz was a babylonian god of vegetation. Jews were weeping because they thought Tammuz was immortal - they had accepted the immortality of the soul.

But the Bible says: “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know nothing.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5)

“Christ has the keys to hell and the grave and death” (Revelation 1:18)

“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” (Revelation 18:4)

Foundation stones of Babylon:
- the authority of man
- the word of man
- the works of man
- the law of man
- the traditions of man

Foundation of the Divine system:
- the authority of God
- the Word of God
- the love of God
- the law of God
- the teachings of God

“Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

“No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)
