Does God exist?
===============

“The host of heaven cannot be numbered” (Jeremiah 33:22)

The fact is, scientists have only recently begun to learn what God said in His Word thousands of years ago: stars are countless.
Scientists estimate about 200 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy alone. They estimate about 200 billion such galaxies!

“The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship. Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him known.” (Psalm 19:1-2)

“Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace” (Job 22:21)

All the complexity of nature, the animals, and the human body tells there MUST be a designer.
